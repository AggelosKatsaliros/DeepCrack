 - Paper: [avaliable soon]. Dec 14, 2017 submitted to Neurocomputing, Jan 21, 2019 accepted.
 - Dataset:

A benchmark dataset for crack detection which is consist of two subset: train and test. 
For each subset, we provide both the RGB images and corresponding pixel-wise annotation maps.

You can find the dataset in `./dataset`, and here are the details:

|Folder|Description|
|:----|:-----|
|`train_img`|RGB images for training|
|`train_lab`|binary annotation for training images|
|`test_img`|RGB images for testing|
|`test_lab`|binary annotation for testing images|
